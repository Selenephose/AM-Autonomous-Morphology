# AM — Autonomous Morphology

A research-grade hierarchical cognitive architecture for:
• world-model learning
• latent abstraction
• symbol lifecycle analysis
• meta-skill emergence
• counterfactual planning

Layered architecture:

Kernel → learns dynamics  
Cortex → reasons about abstractions

This is not an LLM wrapper.  
This is a world-model-centric cognitive system.
