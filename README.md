AM (Autonomous Morphology) is a research-grade experimental cognitive agent designed to study how autonomous systems can self-organize internal world models, abstract latent representations, and form reusable skills through interaction, prediction, and internal optimization.

This project explores how agents can construct internal representations of their environment, compress sensory experience into latent abstractions, and develop reusable behavioral structures through curiosity-driven learning and counterfactual evaluation.

## Research Focus

This repository serves as a research sandbox for studying:

• Latent abstraction learning
• Predictive world modeling
• Counterfactual planning and imagination
• Skill emergence and reuse
• Self-organizing cognitive structures
• Curiosity-driven exploration

Internal representation compression

## Long-Term Goal

The long-term goal of AM is to investigate how complex adaptive behavior can arise from simple learning primitives, and how scalable cognitive architectures can be constructed without hard-coded symbolic reasoning.
AM is not a benchmark model; it is an evolving research organism.

## Repository Structure

core/        Core cognitive kernels and learning systems
envs/        Training and simulation environments
experiments/ Runnable experiments and ablations
analysis/    Metrics, plots, and evaluation tools
docs/        Design notes and architecture documents


## Current Architecture

Layer-1 (Brainstem) implements:

• Latent abstraction encoder  
• Predictive world model  
• Symbolic concept formation  
• Reusable skill emergence  
• Concept lifecycle tracking  

This layer already exhibits autonomous concept formation and skill reuse.
