# AM-Autonomous-Morphology
A research-grade experimental cognitive agent that learns internal world models, abstracts latent representations, and forms reusable skills through imagination-based planning.

The project explores how agents can self-organize abstract representations and reusable behavioral structures through interaction, curiosity, and internal prediction error.

This repository serves as a research sandbox for studying:

• Latent abstraction learning  
• Predictive world modeling  
• Counterfactual planning  
• Skill emergence and reuse  
• Self-organizing cognitive structures  

The long-term goal is to investigate how complex adaptive behavior can arise from simple learning primitives.
